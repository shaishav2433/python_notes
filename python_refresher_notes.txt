Understand difference between keyword argument vs positional argument, later must go first during function defination & function call


no spaces in function bracket equal sign
e,g def add_values (a, b=5) , add_values(b=6, a=3)


function return none by default, it is not recommended having different data type returned by function.


# lambda function syntax: lambda x, y: x + y ==> function with parameter x and y and return value of x+y
# use with assignment to different function name
add = lambda x, y: x + y
add(5,4) # returns 9
# use 2 - direct
(lambda x, y: x + y)(5,4)


# dict comprehension refer to user_login.py
embedded_list = [[0,"data_at_0"],[1,"data_at_1"]]
dict1 = {list[0]: list[1] for list in embedded_list}

# Object oriented programming.

a function inside class is called method , 3 types of method 0 instance, static and class
a method with __ is called special method/magic method
